## 🤔 Why StoryCraft Studio?

In a world of generic text editors and bloated writing software, StoryCraft Studio carves its own niche by focusing on a holistic, AI-augmented narrative design process.

- **✍️ From Macro to Micro:** Most tools focus only on writing. We cover the _entire_ creative lifecycle — from high-level plot structure and world-building down to sentence-by-sentence prose refinement.
- **🧠 Intelligent Partnership:** The AI is not a ghostwriter — it's a Socratic partner, a tireless brainstormer, and a creative muse. It's designed to break blocks and expand your own potential, not replace it.
- **🔒 Ultimate Privacy & Ownership:** Your manuscript and project data stay on this device by default (IndexedDB in the browser, or local files in the desktop app). Cloud AI features send only the prompts and context you trigger to the provider you configure. Use local/Ollama/WebLLM mode if you want AI without sending text to any cloud API. There is no StoryCraft account — you stay in control of exports and backups.
- **🔬 Built-in Quality Tools:** Go beyond writing with the AI Critic, Plot-Hole Detector, and RAG Consistency Checker — tools that help you catch narrative weaknesses before your readers do.
- **⚡ Browser-Native AI:** A 4-layer local inference stack (WebGPU → ONNX WASM → Transformers.js → heuristics) means local AI works even without Ollama — entirely in-browser, no server, no download manager.

## 🚀 Features: A Comprehensive Creative Suite

### 📊 Dynamic Project Dashboard

Your mission control. Track word counts against custom goals, visualize project statistics, manage your title and logline with AI assistance, and access all views from a single hub. Includes **readability sampling** (Flesch-style heuristic), **scene-timeline rule hints**, and the optional **Project Health Score** card — all computed locally without sending manuscript text to the cloud.

### ✍️ Three-Panel Manuscript Editor

A focused, distraction-free writing environment. The central editor is flanked by a draggable chapter **Navigator** and a project **Inspector**. An advanced overlay provides real-time highlighting and linking for `@character` and `#world` mentions, turning your manuscript into a living document. Includes **Zen Mode** for full-screen distraction-free writing, **spell-check with suggestions**, and **grammar & style hints**.

### 🎬 Plot-Board v2 _(Visual Story Planning)_

Three co-existing modes for visual story planning:

| Mode | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| **Swimlane** | Kanban drag-and-drop across 3-act columns |
| **Canvas** | Free-form pan/zoom board — position scenes anywhere; pinch-to-zoom on mobile |
| **Timeline** | Gantt-style scene timeline with rule hints |

**SVG Connection Layer:** Draw cause-effect, parallel, subplot, temporal, and character-arc arrows between scenes. Hover to edit label or type; click to select and delete. Keyboard accessible (`role="button"` + `tabIndex`).

**Subplot System:** Color-coded subplot lanes with filter toggle — dims unrelated scenes to focus on one storyline at a time.

**Tension Curve:** 800×200 SVG chart showing auto-computed dramatic tension (status-based 0–10 score) with drag-to-override points. Beat sheet overlays: Three-Act, Save the Cat!, Hero's Journey marker presets.

**Mini-map:** Fixed 80×50 px SVG overview in corner for spatial orientation on the free-form canvas.

### 📖 Real-Time Book Preview

Scrivener-style "Scrivenings" mode — a scrollable, paginated view of your entire manuscript rendered as formatted prose. Updates live as you write:

- **Collapsible TOC sidebar** with IntersectionObserver-driven active chapter highlight
- **Font controls:** family (system-ui / serif / monospace), size (12–24 px), word-count margin annotations
- **Fullscreen mode** (`position: fixed inset-0`) with ESC-to-dismiss; independent of the app theme
- **Export button** opens the Export view in EPUB mode

### 📊 Progress Tracker Dashboard

Dedicated analytics view — the first thing a writer sees each day:

- **Circular SVG progress ring** for today's word-count goal
- **Live session timer** (`role="timer"`) with start/stop; shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+S`
- **Streak display** — current streak and longest streak computed from writing history
- **30-day velocity area chart** (pure SVG, no external chart library)
- **12-week GitHub-style heatmap** (84 `<rect>` cells, 5 intensity shades)
- **Inline goal editor** for daily/weekly word targets

### 🗒️ Reference Panel & Threaded Comments

**Reference Panel** — an iPad-style 6-tab sidebar in the manuscript editor:

| Tab | Content |
|-----|---------|
| Characters | Mini-cards for scene's characters with backstory excerpt |
| World | Linked locations with geography excerpt |
| Notes | Inline editable notes synced to the scene |
| Binder | Linked binder node content |
| Comments | Threaded comment panel (see below) |
| Revisions | Per-scene snapshot history |

**Threaded Comments:** Add comments anchored to any scene, reply inline, resolve/unresolve with a badge counter in the toolbar.

**Per-Scene Revision History:** IndexedDB-backed snapshots with word-level diff view and named snapshot labels. Two-step restore with confirmation.

### 🕸️ Character Relationship Graph _(Interactive Visualization)_

An interactive, force-directed graph that visualizes all relationships between your characters. See at a glance who knows whom, who is in conflict, and how your cast interconnects — invaluable for complex multi-POV narratives.

### 📚 Intelligent Story Template Library

Jumpstart your creativity with a library of classic structures (Three-Act, Hero's Journey, Save the Cat! Beat Sheet, Fichtean Curve) and genre templates (Fantasy, Thriller, Horror, Romance, Space Opera, and more). **Remix any template** by dragging, editing, or adding sections. **Personalize with AI** to generate chapter-specific prompts based on your unique concept. Browse **Community Templates** alongside your own saved templates.

### 🤖 AI Outline Generator

The ultimate cure for the blank page. Provide a concept and let the AI architect a detailed, chapter-by-chapter outline. Advanced controls let you specify genre, pacing, key characters, setting, and even mandate a specific plot twist. The result is a fully interactive, editable structure you can apply to your manuscript with one click.

### 👥 Advanced Character Dossiers

Breathe life into your cast. Use the **AI Profile Generator** to create compelling backstories, motivations, and personality traits from a single concept. Generate a unique **AI character portrait** in a choice of styles (realistic, anime, cartoon, comic book). Manage relationships and character arcs with dedicated fields.

### 🌍 Expansive World-Building Atlas

Construct the universe of your story. Define your world's history and lore, create interactive timelines and location lists, and let the **AI World Generation** feature write rich, consistent world-building content. Generate an atmospheric **ambiance image** to capture your world's visual identity.

### ✨ AI Writing Studio _(10 Specialized AI Tools)_

Your tireless creative co-pilot, available at every stage:

| Tool                      | What it does                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Continue Writing**      | Seamlessly continues from your last sentence in your voice                 |
| **Improve Writing**       | Rewrites selected prose for clarity, flow, and impact                      |
| **Change Tone**           | Shifts the register of any passage (darker, funnier, more formal, …)       |
| **Generate Dialogue**     | Creates authentic, in-character conversations                              |
| **Brainstorm Ideas**      | Generates creative plot possibilities for what comes next                  |
| **Generate Synopsis**     | Creates a concise, polished summary of any section                         |
| **Grammar & Style Check** | Catches errors and suggests stylistic improvements                         |
| **AI Critic**             | Delivers an honest, structured literary critique of your prose             |
| **Plot-Hole Detector**    | Analyzes your manuscript for logical inconsistencies and continuity errors |
| **Consistency Checker**   | Cross-references your text against your character and world data via RAG   |

### 🔍 RAG Consistency Checker _(Advanced)_

A dedicated view using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to give the AI deep, contextualized knowledge of your _entire_ project. It cross-checks your manuscript against character profiles and world-building notes to surface subtle inconsistencies and continuity errors that a read-through would miss.

### 🚀 ProForge Ultimate Author Pipeline _(Experimental — `enableProForge`)_

An 8-stage agentic manuscript editing pipeline that transforms the Writer view into a full **Human-in-the-Loop** editorial workflow — from raw draft to publication-ready manuscript. All processing runs client-side; no cloud dependency for the pipeline itself.

**Stage sequence:** Intake & Diagnostic → Structural → Line/Prose → Copy Edit → Proof → Production → Publishing → Analytics

Key design points:
- **Never auto-modifies** the manuscript — every agent output awaits explicit author approval in the Review Panel.
- **SupervisorAgent** applies heuristic quality gates between stages and can trigger one automatic retry when it detects a fallback output or low-quality score.
- **Self-evaluation loop** (`BaseAgent.selfReflect()`) flags incoherent AI output for a second-pass before surfacing to the author.
- **Critical Actions summary card** + severity-grouped Review Panel with Quick Accept for high-confidence suggestions (≥ 0.85).
- Enable via **Settings → Experimental Features → ProForge Pipeline**.

See [`docs/PROFORGE-PIPELINE.md`](docs/PROFORGE-PIPELINE.md) for full architecture, types, and agent reference.

### 🌊 Flow Mode _(Distraction-Free Writing)_

A single-keystroke toggle that collapses all sidebars and chrome, leaving only the manuscript editor. Exit with `Escape` or the same toggle key. State is stored in the Zustand `transientUiStore` (`flowMode` flag) so it resets on page load.

### 🗣️ Voice Dictation & WASM Voice Engines _(v1.17 foundation + v1.19.0 WASM scaffold)_

Built-in speech-to-text via the browser's Web Speech API. Dictate scenes hands-free directly into the manuscript editor or into the Command Palette search field. **v1.19.0** adds WASM STT/VAD engine scaffolds:

- **`WasmSttEngine`** (`services/voice/wasmSttEngine.ts`) — Whisper.cpp WASM interface scaffold (model download, chunked inference, 99+ language detection).
- **`SileroVadEngine`** (`services/voice/sileroVadEngine.ts`) — Silero VAD v4 via ONNX Runtime Web (~2 MB model, lazy-loaded, replaces energy-threshold VAD).
- Web Speech API fallback active in all environments; WASM engines activate when model is downloaded and `featureFlags.enableVoiceWasm` is on.

### ⌨️ Command Palette & Productivity Hub

A keyboard-first **command palette** (⌘K / Ctrl+K, plus configurable bindings in **Settings → Shortcuts**) drives navigation, AI actions, editor helpers, and project tools from one surface:

- **Typed command registry** (`services/commands/`) — fuzzy scoring with highlighted matches, category sections, optional AI-suggested rows from lightweight project signals (no extra network call required).
- **Recent & pinned commands** — persisted preferences (versioned local storage); pin/unpin from the palette context menu.
- **Voice input** — Web Speech integration for dictating palette queries where supported.
- **Global shortcuts** — `hooks/useGlobalKeyboardShortcuts.ts` + `services/keyboard/` evaluate Redux-backed shortcut bindings; conflicts surface in the Shortcuts editor.
- **Settings** — filter controls via the Settings search bar (`services/settingsSearchHints.ts`); **Import / Export** of a Zod-validated, privacy-conscious settings JSON subset (**Settings → Data** via `services/settingsExchange.ts`).
- **Help Center (v1.9)** — `services/help/helpCatalog.ts` drives 50+ articles across 10 categories (including **Technical Documentation** and **Settings Guide**); full-text search (`helpSearch.ts`); AI assistant uses 13 offline doc chunks; **Try it** actions via `tryActionId`; tours from `services/spotlightTour.ts`. All five locales include translated article bodies (es/fr/it complete as of v1.9).
- **UI primitives** — shared **`Tooltip`**, **`EmptyState`**, and toast rows that trigger a **registered command** via `commandId` (see `features/status/statusSlice.ts`).
- **Feature flags** — `enableProjectHealthScore` (dashboard card) and `enableCrossProjectSearch` (cross-project index) live in `features/featureFlags/featureFlagsSlice.ts`.

### 🔭 Cross-Project Search _(v2 — Privacy-Preserving Index)_

Search across **all your projects** without loading them into memory. An IndexedDB-based privacy-preserving index (DB v8, `projects-index-store`) stores only lightweight metadata per project — title, logline, word count, character names — never manuscript plaintext.

- **Two-phase search:** Phase 1 queries the index (instant); Phase 2 loads the full project on demand for deep-match excerpts.
- **Auto-indexing** on every save via `listenerMiddleware` (behind the `enableCrossProjectSearch` flag).
- **Index management:** `crossProjectIndexService.ts` exposes `indexProject`, `listIndexedProjects`, `removeProjectIndex`.
- Fully localized across all 5 UI languages.

### 🤝 Real-Time Collaboration with Full E2E Encryption

Real-time P2P co-editing via **Yjs + collab-transport** (vendor fork of y-webrtc 10.3.0 with E2E encryption baked in) with multiple signaling endpoints for automatic failover:

- **RTCDataChannel in-flight E2E encryption** — all Yjs sync updates and awareness protocol messages over peer-to-peer WebRTC data channels are encrypted via AES-256-GCM using a room key. Shipped via `packages/collab-transport` (vendor fork with applied patch).
- **Room isolation** — room IDs are derived from a SHA-256 hash of the room name.
- **AES-256-GCM key derivation** — `collaborationService.ts` includes `deriveEncryptionKey()` (PBKDF2, 310 000 iterations, SHA-256), `encryptUpdate()` / `decryptUpdate()` (AES-256-GCM, 12-byte random IV), and `getEncryptionStatus()`.
- **Encryption status badge** — CollaborationPanel shows green `E2E Key Derived (AES-256-GCM)` or amber `Room isolation only` based on whether a room password is set.
- **Security warning banner** (`role="alert"`, `aria-live="polite"`, WCAG 2.2 AA) visible before connecting explains that public signaling relays observe connection metadata; disappears after connect.
- **Configurable signaling URLs** in Settings → Collaboration.
- Default signaling endpoints: `wss://y-webrtc-signaling.fly.dev`, `wss://signaling.yjs.dev`.

#### Self-host signaling (Cloudflare Worker)

1. Deploy a y-webrtc-compatible signaling worker using an established open-source recipe.
2. Add your endpoint to `SIGNALING_SERVERS` in `services/collaborationService.ts`.
3. Allow your endpoint in the CSP `connect-src` directive in `index.html`.
4. Keep at least one fallback endpoint during migration to avoid downtime.

### 🔒 IDB At-Rest Encryption _(B-1, v1.19.0)_

All project data, snapshots, and settings stored in IndexedDB can be encrypted at rest via `services/storage/storageEncryptionService.ts`:

- **AES-256-GCM** with a PBKDF2-derived key (310 000 iterations, SHA-256, 32-byte random salt).
- Gated behind `featureFlags.enableIdbAtRestEncryption` (off by default — no migration risk).
- Web build: passphrase-entry unlock screen on cold start (session-scoped in-memory key).
- Tauri build: transparent OS-keychain protection via `tauri-plugin-stronghold` (no user friction).
- GDPR-compliant: encrypted blobs are unreadable without the passphrase, even from the browser profile directory.

### 🔐 Encrypted Library Backup

One-click encrypted export of your entire project library from **Settings → Data**:

- Archives all projects as a **ZIP** containing `META.json` + `vault.bin`.
- `vault.bin` is encrypted with **AES-256-GCM** — the decryption key is derived from your chosen passphrase using PBKDF2.
- No plaintext project data ever leaves your device unencrypted.
- Import on any device using the same passphrase to restore your full library.

### 💾 Robust Offline-First Data Management

- **Auto-save** to IndexedDB on every change (debounced, non-blocking)
- **Snapshot system** — automatic and manual project backups, restorable to any point in time
- **Import / Export** project files as JSON or encrypted ZIP backups
- **Undo / Redo** with a 100-step history (Redux-Undo)
- **IndexedDB v8** schema with dedicated stores per data type and automatic migration

### 📤 Polished Export Suite

- **Markdown** (`.md`), **Plain Text** (`.txt`), **PDF** (with titlepage, configurable font and spacing)
- **Word / DOCX** — `.docx` generation via `docx` + `jszip` (lazy-loaded)
- **AI Synopsis** — generate a one-page synopsis before exporting
- **Paste-friendly format** — copy rich text for Google Docs / Notion
- Selective content inclusion (title & logline, characters, worlds, manuscript sections)

### 📱 Progressive Web App (PWA) v3.0

- **Offline-first** — all assets cached via Service Worker (Workbox-based)
- **Installable** on desktop and mobile (iOS & Android)
- **App shortcuts** for quick access from the home screen icon
- Update notifications and background sync support

### 🎨 Highly Customizable Workspace

- **Dark / Light** themes with smooth transitions
- Adjustable **font family, size, line height**, and **paragraph spacing**
- **Indent first line** toggle for traditional novel formatting
- Tunable **AI Creativity Level** (Focused → Balanced → Imaginative)
- Full **Accessibility settings** (high contrast, reduced motion, color-blind modes) — WCAG 2.2 AA–oriented

### 🌐 Full Multi-Language Support

Shipped UI locales with **2 062 i18n keys** across all 5 languages — zero hardcoded user-facing strings:

- 🇩🇪 **German** (Deutsch)
- 🇬🇧 **English**
- 🇫🇷 **French** (Français)
- 🇪🇸 **Spanish** (Español)
- 🇮🇹 **Italian** (Italiano)

All five trees stay in key parity (`pnpm run i18n:check`). Language selection persists via `localStorage`. Selector available in Settings, the Welcome Portal, and the Command Palette.

**RTL Layout Beta** (`enableRtlLayout` flag, off by default): Arabic (ar) and Hebrew (he) locale stubs added in v1.19.0. When the flag is on, `html[dir="rtl"]` is set and a BiDi context provider mirrors layout. Full RTL translation content is a v2.0 milestone.

**Spotlight tour:** After first launch, a short guided tour (driver.js) highlights navigation, command palette, and Settings; restart anytime from the Dashboard ("Guided tour") or Help.

| **Local 4** | Transformers.js | WASM / WebGPU | Xenova/distilgpt2 and compatible Hugging Face models |

> **Privacy-first routing:** WebLLM, ONNX, and Transformers.js run entirely in your browser — no network call, no API key needed. Automatic fallback down the stack ensures AI features always work, even offline.

### WebGPU Hardware Detection

`services/ai/webGpuDetectorService.ts` queries `navigator.gpu.requestAdapter()` and reports:
- **Status:** `available` / `unavailable` / `unknown`
- **Adapter name** and **architecture** (via `requestAdapterInfo()`)
- **VRAM tier:** `high` (≥ 8 GB) / `medium` (≥ 4 GB) / `low` — heuristic from `adapter.limits.maxBufferSize`

The Settings → AI panel shows a live GPU status badge with adapter details and model selectors for WebLLM and ONNX models.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+) is all you need for the web app — no installation required.

For local development: **Node ≥ 22**, **pnpm 10** (`npm install -g pnpm`). For the desktop app: **Rust + Tauri CLI** (`cargo install tauri-cli`).

### 🔐 Setting Up AI

StoryCraft Studio supports local-only AI (no API key) as well as BYOK cloud providers:

#### Option A: Google Gemini / OpenAI / Claude / Grok (BYOK cloud)

1. **Get your key** — e.g. at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) (free tier available)
2. **Open Settings** → AI Provider → select your provider
3. **Enter your API key** — encrypted with AES-256-GCM and stored only in your browser's IndexedDB; never transmitted except to the provider you select

**Security best practices:**
- ✅ Your key never leaves your device in plaintext
- ✅ Encrypted at rest via the Web Crypto API
- 🔒 **Recommended:** Restrict your Gemini key to `*.github.io` in Google AI Studio

#### Option B: Ollama (local server)

1. **Install Ollama** and pull a model: `ollama pull qwen3:8b`
2. Start Ollama (it runs a local HTTP server at `http://localhost:11434` by default)
3. In Settings → AI Provider → select **Ollama** and verify the connection

#### Option C: Browser-Native AI (WebGPU / ONNX / Transformers.js)

No installation, no server, no API key — AI runs directly in your browser:

1. **Open Settings → AI Provider** → select **WebLLM**
2. StoryCraft Studio auto-detects WebGPU support and displays your GPU adapter + VRAM tier
3. **Choose a model** from the dropdown (Llama 3.2 1B/3B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Gemma 2 2B) and click pre-download
4. If no WebGPU is available, the ONNX Runtime Web layer activates automatically (WASM, any device)
5. Transformers.js serves as a further fallback — WebGPU or WASM backend, no manual config needed

> All local-inference layers run entirely in-browser. No network call is made for AI inference.

### 🚀 Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Enable GitHub Pages:** Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**
3. **Push to `main`** — deployment runs automatically via GitHub Actions
4. **Access your app** at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/StoryCraft-Studio/`

### ☁️ Deploying to Vercel (alternative)

Vercel is a **first-class** hosting option alongside Pages: connect the repo, use **`pnpm run build`**, output **`dist`**, SPA routing via **[`vercel.json`](vercel.json)**. Use a **custom domain** on Vercel with Vite **`base: '/'`** for clean asset URLs; keep API keys **only in the app** (IndexedDB), not in Vercel env vars for inference. Full checklist: **[`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)**.

### 💻 Local Development

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/qnbs/StoryCraft-Studio.git
cd StoryCraft-Studio

# Install dependencies (Node ≥ 22, pnpm 10)
pnpm install

# Start the development server (http://localhost:3000)
pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Preview the production build locally
pnpm run preview

# Run unit tests
pnpm run test:run

# Run unit tests with coverage
pnpm run test:coverage

# Type check
pnpm run typecheck

# Lint (Biome — warnings fail like CI)
pnpm run lint

# Check i18n key parity + rebuild runtime bundles
pnpm run i18n:check

# Tauri desktop app (requires Rust)
pnpm run tauri:dev
```

> **Note:** The production build uses Vite manual chunking — `vendor-ai-onnx` for `onnxruntime-web`, separate chunks for `docx`/`jszip`/Yjs — to keep the main bundle small and comply with Workbox's 8 MiB Service Worker cache limit.

### 🌐 Custom Domain Setup

1. Create a `CNAME` file in `public/` with your domain:

   ```bash
   echo "storycraft.yourdomain.com" > public/CNAME
   ```

2. Configure DNS at your registrar:
   - **Subdomain** → CNAME → `your-username.github.io`
   - **Apex domain** → A records to `185.199.108.153` – `185.199.111.153`
3. Push changes — the build auto-detects `CNAME` and switches the base path to `/`
4. Enable HTTPS in GitHub Pages settings

### 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Solution                                                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank page after deploy   | Verify `base` in `vite.config.ts` matches your repo name              |
| Assets not loading (404)  | Check `manifest.json` `start_url`; verify `404.html` is in `public/`  |
| AI features not working   | Check API key in Settings; verify it starts with `AIza` and has quota |
| WebLLM not loading        | Requires a WebGPU-capable browser (Chrome 113+); check GPU status badge in Settings |
| Language resets on reload | Clear site data and re-select — should persist via `localStorage`     |
| IndexedDB migration error | Open DevTools → Application → IndexedDB → delete both stores and reload |

## 🧪 CI & Local Validation

The main pipeline is [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Optional **desktop** bundles: [`.github/workflows/tauri-build.yml`](.github/workflows/tauri-build.yml) (`workflow_dispatch` / `v*` tags). Full reference: **[`docs/CI.md`](docs/CI.md)** and **[`docs/TAURI-CI.md`](docs/TAURI-CI.md)**. **CI health / audit log:** **[`.github/CI-AUDIT.md`](.github/CI-AUDIT.md)**.

| Job          | When / needs        | What it does |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------ |
| `security`   | every run            | `pnpm audit --audit-level=high`; `osv-scanner` vulnerability scan; gitleaks secrets scan; PRs: dependency review |
| `quality`    | after `security`     | Biome lint + format, **i18n key parity** (`pnpm run i18n:check`), `tsc --noEmit`, Vitest + V8 coverage (Node **22** + **24**); Codecov upload |
| `build`      | after `quality`      | Production Vite build, **chunk budget** (max 7 000 KB/chunk, 4 500 KB entry), **rollup analyze** artifact; on `main`: SLSA provenance attestation + Pages artifact |
| `e2e`        | after `quality`      | Playwright **Chromium**, `CI=true`; JUnit artifact uploaded for per-test PR annotations |
| `mutation`   | after `quality`      | Stryker (`pnpm run mutation`); `break: 75` enforced (high: 85, low: 70) |
| `lighthouse` | after `build`        | LHCI against `dist` — accessibility `error:0.95`, CLS `error:0.1`, performance `warn:0.4`, SEO `warn:0.8` |
| `storybook`  | after `quality`      | Static Storybook build artifact |
| `deploy`     | `main` only          | GitHub Pages after **`build` + `e2e`** succeed |
| `scorecard`  | weekly + `main` push | OpenSSF Scorecard — SARIF uploaded to GitHub Code Scanning |

**Current test metrics (2026-06-01, v1.19.0+):**
- **4 200+ unit tests** across **390+ test files** — all passing (2026-06-01 CI run)
- Coverage: **73 % lines · 58 % branches · 65 % functions · 71 % statements** (CI-reported; see Codecov badge)
- Vitest thresholds: lines ≥ 73 · statements ≥ 71 · branches ≥ 58 · functions ≥ 65 — all green
- i18n: **2160 keys × 5 locales** (en/de/fr/es/it); ar/he stubs (2074 keys)

**CI-cloud-first workflow (recommended):** On constrained hardware run **`pnpm run lint && pnpm run i18n:check && pnpm run typecheck`** locally, then push and let CI handle coverage, E2E, Lighthouse, and Stryker. Authoritative numbers come from CI artifacts (Codecov, JUnit). After CI goes green, update the README badges and `AUDIT.md` quality-gate line from the reported metrics. See **[`docs/CI.md`](docs/CI.md) § Cloud CI-first vs local development** for the full post-merge doc-update checklist.

**Low-resource / laptop workflow:** **`pnpm run test:run`** exercises Vitest without `--coverage` — fast and memory-light. Full coverage (`pnpm exec vitest run --coverage`) is intentionally RAM-heavy; rely on the CI `quality` job unless you are debugging a specific threshold.

**Quality-gate parity (matches CI `quality` job exactly):**

```bash
pnpm run lint && pnpm run i18n:check && pnpm run typecheck && pnpm exec vitest run --coverage
```

**Simulate CI locally with [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act):**

```bash
npm install -g act
act pull_request --job security --job quality
act push --job build --job e2e
```

Shared Playwright helpers (`waitForSpaReady`, `ensureBlankProject`, `clickNavItem`) live in **`tests/e2e/helpers.ts`** — do **not** rely on `networkidle` with the Vite dev server (HMR/WebSocket). Details: **`docs/CI.md`**.

## 🚀 A Creative Workflow

1. **Conceive** — Start in the **Welcome Portal** with a Template, the AI Outline Generator, or a blank manuscript.
2. **Build** — Create **Characters** and **Worlds** with AI. Visualize your cast in the **Character Relationship Graph**.
3. **Structure** — Refine your plot in the **Outline Generator** or arrange scenes visually on the **Scene Board**.
4. **Write** — Immerse yourself in the **Manuscript** editor. `@mentions` link characters and worlds. Progress is saved automatically.
5. **Enhance** — Use the **AI Writing Studio** to continue, improve, generate dialogue, or brainstorm.
6. **Review** — Run the **AI Critic** for literary feedback, the **Plot-Hole Detector** for logic issues, and the **Consistency Checker** for continuity.
7. **Snapshot** — Save a project version before major revisions. Restore to any snapshot anytime.
8. **Export** — Export as Markdown, plain text, Word/DOCX, or a formatted **PDF** with an AI-generated synopsis. Back up your entire library as an encrypted ZIP.
